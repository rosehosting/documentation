All data returned by the API is in JSON format. There is _no_ plan to add XML.

### Access Tokens

Reading public data from Traq doesn't require an API token, however restricted
data does.

API tokens are per-user. Users can get their API token by going to the UserCP.

When fetching restricted data from the API, supply the API token in either a
request header `Access-token` or a `POST` parameter called `access_token`.

### Fetching Data

To fetch data from the API, simply append `.json` to the end of the URL.

For example, if we want to fetch a list of projects, the URL would be:

    http://path.to/traq/projects.json

However, if you're trying to access restricted data, such as a private project
or data from the AdminCP or Project Settings pages, you will need to provide an
API access token.

### Writing Data

_Writing data via the API requires an API token._

Writing data the API is done via `POST` with the data being sent as `POST` data.

Here's an example using `curl`:

    curl http://path.to/traq/my_projects/tickets/new -d access_token=3c3f1af318fa8c78b7caef59ac016c90cc8179b8 \
      -d summary="Ticket summary" -d description="Ticket description"

The API will then return a JSON response containing, `status`, `version`, and `ticket`.

The `status` value on success is `1`, and `0` on failure. The `version` value is the API version.

The created ticket is in `ticket`.
